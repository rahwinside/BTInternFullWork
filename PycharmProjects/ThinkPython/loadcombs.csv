,,,Loadcase combination sheet for Hypermesh,,,,,Note-1. First loadcase must start from row7 only   2.There is no limit on number of loadcases and unit loads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,3.Unit loads can be assigned random IDs   4. SPC is considered as one unit load case.If SPC collectors are there in HyperMesh then it should be reflected in unit cells with Zero Scality factor ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
